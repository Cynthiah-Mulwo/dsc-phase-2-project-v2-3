# PHASE 2 PROJECT
# KING COUNTY HOUSE SALE ANALYSIS
# Project Description
## Introduction
With nearly 2.2 million residents, King County is the largest county in Washington State. Nationally, it is the 13th largest by population and ninth largest by total employment. Two million of its residents live in one of the 39 cities in the county and the remaining 200,000 in the unincorporated area. Seattle, the largest city in the county, is home to 730,000 residents
It is home to Seattle, the state's largest city, and is a hub of innovation, technology, and creative industries. The housing market in King County has been one of the fastest-growing in the country, with strong demand and limited supply leading to a highly competitive market.
Several nationally-known businesses are collectively the major economic drivers for the region: Amazon, Boeing Commercial Airplanes, Microsoft, Starbucks and the University of Washington. These large businesses, and along with smaller enterprises, have led King County out of the Great Recession and into a period of overall economic growth.

# The challenge
At its core, the housing crisis is driven by a supply and demand challenge that is two-fold. First, since 2012, King County’s population has grown faster than new homes have been built, creating a growing gap between supply and demand. Second, King County’s population has not grown evenly across the income spectrum. Sixty percent of the new households in King County between 2006 and 2016 earned USD 125,000 or more per year, while 18 percent earned less than USD 50,000. Middle income earners constituted only 22 percent of new households

New real estate developers are planning to build new housing facilities and there has been a problem in evaluating homes in King County. 
Objectives
Throughout the course of the project, we will answer several questions:
    • To develop a model that will help in identifying the attributes that bring more value to the houses, hence bringing maximum profit. Specifically, to uncover:
    • Which features have the biggest impact on the sale price of a house?
    • How much does location affect the sale price of a house?
    • To create a regression model to advice developers on how to accurately price a property
    
    Our Role as data scientists is to advice New real estate developers who are planning to build new housing facilities on what factors come into play while evaluating new housing facilities in King County
